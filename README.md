## Notebooks

- `ss_rsvm_breast_cancer.ipynb`  
  Experiment on the Breast Cancer dataset.

- `ss_rsvm_spambase_email.ipynb`  
  Experiment on the Spambase email dataset.

- `ss_svm_n_times.ipynb`  
  Runs the SVM experiment multiple times to evaluate average performance.

## Runtime Notes (Google Colab)

The notebooks were executed on Google Colab.

Approximate running times:

- `ss_rsvm_breast_cancer.ipynb`  
  Runtime: ~1 minute

- `ss_rsvm_spambase_email.ipynb`  
  Runtime: ~5–6 minutes

- `ss_svm_n_times.ipynb`  
  Runtime: ~80 minutes depending on the number of iterations.

Note: `ss_svm_n_times.ipynb` may take significantly longer to run because the experiment is executed 100 times to compute the average performance of the model.



## Environment Setup

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


```
